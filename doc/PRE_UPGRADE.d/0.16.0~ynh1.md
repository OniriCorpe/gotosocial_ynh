⚠️ Starting with this 0.16.0 version, GoToSocial offers a registration page.  
Please be sure you deactivated registrations if you don't want to.

Relevant changelog quote:
> **Sign up / registration**: In this release, you can open your instance to new registrations (aka sign-ups) via the new signup page at `https://__DOMAIN__/signup`. No more manually creating new users via the CLI :)
> Documentation here: <https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/admin/signups/>
>
> **Accounts overview for moderators**: To support the new sign-up feature, and help instance admins to moderate, we made a new section in the settings panel where admins + moderators can get an overview of accounts, and filter by instance, status, and more. You'll find this new accounts view in the settings panel.
