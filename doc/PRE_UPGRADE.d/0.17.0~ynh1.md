⚠️ This release contains several database migrations which will run the first time you start up this new version.  
**Be sure not to interrupt this migration process. This will take anywhere between a few seconds and an hour or even longer (on slower hardware / big databases). Please be patient!**  
We had to rejig the entire statuses table to introduce interaction policies (see [release notes](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/releases/tag/v0.17.0)). ⚠️

Also, this is the first ever BETA release of GoToSocial. Say hello to v0.17.0 Selective Sloth.
